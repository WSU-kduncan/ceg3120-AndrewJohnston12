# Andrew Johnston Project 2 

# SETUP

# How to get an API
You can get an API from Discord by going to the Discord Developer Portal and going to your bot and requesting the OAToken
# Where to put it to work with the code 
there is a file called ".env" that will contain your OAToken and you need to use the line of code DISCORD_TOKEN=[Your token here]
# Dependencies
The two main packages that needed to be installed was Discord.py and python-dotenv but I had a blast with figuring out an error and I also needed to install asyncio also.

# Usage 

# The changes made with the commands
the command I chose was to change towel! to elephant and I have 4 different quotes from different people instead of quotes from hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

# Research
A really good option is to have something like AWS host the bot and then just make sure that is running properly and I believe this is the best way because this means that the server can run 24/7 and only needed to be taken down when it needs maintenance
